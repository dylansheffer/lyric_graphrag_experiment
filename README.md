<CONTEXT>
To set up Microsoft GraphRAG, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
2. **Dependencies**: Install required libraries.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag
   cd graphrag
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Initialize GraphRAG**:
   Create a directory for your input files and initialize GraphRAG:
   ```bash
   mkdir my_data
   graph_rag --init my_data
   ```

4. **Prepare Input Data**:
   Place your text or CSV files in the `my_data` directory. These files will be used to create the knowledge graph.

5. **Indexing**:
   Run the indexing process to create the knowledge graph:
   ```bash
   graph_rag --index my_data
   ```

6. **Querying**:
   Once the indexing is complete, you can start querying the knowledge graph:
   ```bash
   graph_rag --query "Your query here"
   ```
